# Coding-the-Game-Snake-in-Python-Using-Pygame-and-OOP

<p align="justify"> This was a project on creating the game “Snake” using Python in order to learn more about object oriented programming. The program uses classes to create the squares and the snake. The individual squares are used to create the snake, the food and the obstacles. Pygame was used to create the gaming interface and draw the components.</p>
